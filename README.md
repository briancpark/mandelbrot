# mandelbrot

An attempt to speed up the computation of the Mandelbrot set using OpenMP in C++. Code mass produces bit map images/frames in `.ppm` format and stitches frames using ffmpeg to create movies and gifs!

Code is highly parallelized through the internal Mandelbrot set calculation, as well as in making a single image! Higher precision is enabled through the use of `unsigned long long int`s and `long double`s. SIMD vectorization was also attempted, but it was very hard trying to figure out how to vectorize complex number computation with C++ complex library, so it was not implemneted. No benchmarks were performed, but runs quite fast when enabling `#pragma omp parallel for` lines. 

## Compilation and Example Usage:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
mkdir output
cmake ..
make
./mandelbrot 2 1750 0.37280535024 -0.2551419600000041 2 1e-15 500 50 output defaultcolormap.txt
```

Program arguments upon compilation are:
```sh
./mandelbrot <threshold> <maxIterations> <centerReal> <centerImaginary> <initialScale> <finalScale> <frameCount> <resolution> <outputFolder> <colorFile>
```

A sample script:
```sh
./mandelbrot 2 1750 0.013438870532012129028364919004019686867528573314565492885548699 0.655614218769465062251320027664617466691295975864786403994151735 2 1e-18 620 50 output defaultcolormap.txt
```
After compilation and execution, ffmpeg can be used to stitch frames together into an mp4 or gif as such:
```sh
ffmpeg -framerate 60 -i output/frame%05d.ppm output.mp4
```
